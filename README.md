# Population ecology internship

For BIO357 - Internship in Ecology (6 weeks)

Developed a short and rudimentary function to simulate a hypothetical population of wild boar under 6 different hunting regimes.
Absolutely no guarantee that it works (undergraduate project). 

Files in the repository:
- simulation_function_internship.R = script containing the function to simulate the population of wild boar
- plots_report_internship.R = script containing the code to run and visualize results of some simulations
- utils_internship.R = contains a helper function, that is "needed" in the plotting script

Repository will be set to private and archived after completion.
